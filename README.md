# ECMAScript_Presentation
Presentation using the framework reveal.js

This program is a presentation using the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) framework. It's my first presentation using this technology, so it's a very simple project.
Gaining experience and preparing for the bootcamp training from Driven-education are the major goals of this project.
